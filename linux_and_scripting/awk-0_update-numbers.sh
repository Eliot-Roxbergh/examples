        #Optional we can set Field Separator (FS) here, default is split by whitespace (we are using fields later.. as in $3)

#awk, so for each line, do the following;

#Found comment, do X
/\/\*.+\*\// {
        new_num+=1

#Line begins with # and found our number in third field, do Y (this is the num we will update)
# /^#/ && gsub(replace_me, new_num_to_write, $3) { new_num+=1; update_num()} #note this will make the replacement FIRST, and then run our commands
        ### OR ###
/^#/ && $3 ~replace_me { $3 = new_num_to_write;  new_num+=1; update_num()}
# These commands can be quite powerful, we could also read the current value, compare it ($3 >= 100), modify it, and then update it... etc. All sorts of things.
#       (now we are replacing the placeholder $replace_me, could also do a more generic: /^[0-9]+/
#       (here, ~ means "contains")
# Of course we could also do a simpler, more naive query, without using field delimiter or our specific placeholder variable:
# /^#.+\s[0-9]+/ {$0 = "new line contents ..." ; new_num+=1; update_num();}

#Finally print current line, including any changes made (this will result in the new file output we want, which we can output it to a new file by redirection > )
