###### GDB ######

gdb --args my-file arg1 arg2 ...
gdb --tui my-file #split screen with source code (same as "ctrl+x a")

# GDB uses several emacs-like bindings
#   When using TUI these might be extra useful:
#     ctrl+x a - enable/disable TUI
#     ctrl+x o - change active window
#     ctrl+x 1 - TUI layout with one window  (show source)
#     ctrl+x 2 - TUI layout with two windows (show source and assembly)
#     ctrl+l - refresh/clear screen
#   It is also possible to show more things, such as register values, in the TUI windows

                   // (e.g. `clear 2` would first try to delete breakpoint on line 2 and if not possible try to delete breakpoint number 2 instead.)

continue

step // or use "next" to avoid stepping into function)
finish //stop after return from current function
print *my_struct //print struct data
display *my_struct //same as print but persistent (show every time it changes!)
where //same as "bt"
list //show code around current line

info registers
info args //arguments to current function
