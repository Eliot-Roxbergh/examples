###### Terminal settings / general ######

#   See also https://www.shell-tips.com/bash/environment-variables/ and https://www.shell-tips.com/bash/shortcuts/

#show bindings for your terminal (i.e. readline bindings)
# (default Bash shortcuts are based on Emac shortcuts)
bind -p 

# Basic, default, Bash bindings to enjoy
#Move one word back:    alt+b  (ctrl+b = move one character instead)
#Move one word forward: alt+f  (ctrl+f = move one character instead)
#Start of line: <HOME> or ctrl+a
#End of line:   <END>  or ctrl+e

#In Bash and other programs (e.g. Git)
# use -- to show that this is the end of commands and next is only user input
# For instance, `cat -- -v` will show the file called "-v" instead of the command -v



###### UNIX stuff ######

#   (see manpage for command for powerful options)
basename #/a/b/bin.c -> bin.c
dirname  #/a/b/bin.c -> /a/b

# "For each NAME, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a command name "
# e.g. type vim -> vim is /usr/bin/vim,
#   or type ls -> ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
type <command>


###### Git ######

#default order is chronological which might get weird if branches have been merged
#   use topo-order to see a more reasonable logical order
git log --topo-order
git log --stat #see files changed

git push origin --delete <branch>
