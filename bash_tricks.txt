# set -e` and `set -u` might be useful (same as #!/bin/bash -eu)
# -u error on unset variable
# -e exit on error (very unreliable, only for the lazy coder, ... should use "| exit 1", or "| my_error()" )
# btw you may not trap in a trap in Bash programming

# Variable types may be used if desired, such as:
readonly
local

# Bash built ins:
shift #to shift parameters, such as input arguments to the left
[] #is the same as test and [[ ]] is a Bash specific "upgrade". These are often used in if statements

# Split string
read #set $IFS to desired separator (default value is <space><tab><newline>)
#And we may split one input string into multiple variables, for instance
